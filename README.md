irbnb Analysis for an asset management company

Group Project ID: - using web scrapping the user can run different locations for various dates in order to assess which properties give the highest return for a possible investment by the asset management company 

——————PROJECT DESCRIPTION——————

This is a mandatory group project part of the course "Programming with Advanced Computer Languages" supervised by Dr. Mario Silic.

The group project was done individually by Alessandro Derchi (Student-ID: 20-624-516) with the pseudonym “Ale” to accomplish this group project in the course.

The coding was done using jupyter notebook and importing pandas, requests bs4 and libraries to perform web scrapping of the AirBnb website.

Example Business Problem:
Due to the global pandemic, a Swiss asset management firm wants to use its newly received capital to invest in the real estate market in a new destination (in this case Bali) before tourism starts to pick up again. The goal is to acquire types of properties and renovate them so that they can be listed on Airbnb at an above average price. Therefore, we need to identify the features that contribute to higher prices in order to maximize the firm’s return on investment.

Methodology:
In order to assess the current market situation, we will assess the demand and the supply side of listed Airbnb properties using webscrapping. In the demonstrated case we chose Bali for the time July 7 to 10,2021. Based on the results we assess the numeric features and filter the ones that are above average with the subsequent qualitative features.
We need to interpret the model to be able to design the appropriate acquisition strategy of apartments that can be offered at higher prices. Without knowing which types of properties to invest in, the asset management firm has lower chances to be profitable and might have lower return on its investment.

The final results is composed of three parts: 
1. Best locations with highest price per night
2. Best type of property with highest ratings 
3. Best ratings with information on which amenities were used, for how many guests, how many bedrooms and baths

——— HOW TO USE THE CODE——-

There are 3 files within this repository.

This file (README.md) is used to give the project description and the instructions on how to run the code and assess its application to the real world done by the student.

Two files contain code: (AD_project_code.ipynb) and (AD_project.ipynb). ((AD_project_code.ipynb)) is the file that is binding and can be tested and used by the professor.  (AD_project.ipynb) only provides the professor with an example of how the student uses the code in a real life example with the implications that can be drawn from it.

No data file needs to be downloaded as the code entails how to access the information and stored inside the file as a data frame. The user has to make sure that she/he has the latest python3 as well as pandas, bs4 and requests libraries downloaded.

Hope you will enjoy the coding experience :)
